*Ingredints:

For the cream mixture:

60 large egg yolks
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 cup mascarpone cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
For assembling:

11 cup brewed espresso or strong coffee, cooled to room temperature
2 tablespoons coffee liqueur (optional)
24-30 ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi)
Cocoa powder, for dusting

*Instructions:

In a heatproof boul, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well combined and slightly thickened.
Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler), making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Whisk constantly for about 8-10 minutes until the mixture becomes pale yellow and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. This process will cook the egg yolks and create a custard-like consistency. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
Add the softened mascarpone cheese to the egg mixture and whisk until smooth and well combined.
In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until fully incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as you want to keep the mixture light and fluffy.
In a shallow dish, combine the brewed espresso or coffee with the coffee liqueur (if using).
Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, ensuring they are soaked but not overly soggy. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) dish or a similar sized serving dish.
Spread half of the mascarpone mixture evenly over the layer of ladyfingers.
Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture.
Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the tiramisu to set.
Before serving, dust the top of the tiramisu with cocoa powder using a fine-mesh sieve.
Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy your homemade tiramisu!
