Ingredients:

    2 tablespoons olive oil
    1 medium onion, chopped
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    2 cans (28 ounces each) whole peeled tomatoes, undrained
    2 cups vegetable broth or chicken broth
    1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
    Salt and pepper to taste
    1/2 cup heavy cream (optional, for a creamier soup)
    Fresh basil leaves, chopped, for garnish (optional)

Instructions:

    Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

    Pour in the canned tomatoes with their juices. Use a wooden spoon to break up the tomatoes into smaller pieces.

    Add the vegetable or chicken broth to the pot. Stir well to combine.

    If desired, add a teaspoon of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

    Bring the soup to a simmer and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

    If you prefer a smoother texture, you can use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot. Alternatively, transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until smooth. Be careful when blending hot liquids.

    Once the soup is blended to your desired consistency, return it to the pot if necessary. Stir in the heavy cream, if using, and let the soup simmer for an additional 5 minutes.

    Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

    Serve hot, garnished with chopped fresh basil leaves if desired. Enjoy your delicious homemade tomato soup!
